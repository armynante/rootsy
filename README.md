##Rootsy

Rootsy was a project that used the Linkedin API to help users find
people in their network who where looking for jobs, and then split the referal
bonus with connections up through their network tree who helped them find that person.

The app crawled your connections and created a temporary indexed database of
possible connections for a given day. A link was made when users reached out to other conenctions,
and if somone was hired, each person down the chain would recive half of the bonus
the previous connection took.

The idea came from a [paper written about using social netowrks to find information](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA_Network_Challenge).

We were about to launch in January 2015, but the Linkedin API was turned off to developers :(
